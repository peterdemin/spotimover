## Move Spotify library between accounts

This is a simple script that uses [unreleased] version of [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy)
to dump Spotify library to a set of JSON files from one account and load it to another account.

Script requires a set of environmental variables for authentication.
See [spotipy docs](http://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authorization-code-flow) for details.
